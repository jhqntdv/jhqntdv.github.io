## Introduction

Under **ASC 718 – Compensation—Stock Compensation**, entities must measure equity-based compensation awards at their **grant-date fair value** and recognize compensation cost over the service period.

A valuation is generally required when:

- Awards contain market conditions or complex economic features (multi-tier hurdles, catch-up provisions...etc).
- Awards are issued by pass-through entities (LLCs or partnerships), where incentive units or profits interests must be measured at fair value.
- Existing awards are modified, requiring reassessment of fair value.
- Changes in capital structure materially affect award economics.

For service-based awards, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis or according to the vesting schedule. For awards with market conditions, the full compensation cost is fixed at the grant date and recognized regardless of whether the market condition is met.

A **Monte Carlo simulation** is used to estimate fair value when payouts depend on market-based performance conditions. ASC 718 identifies Monte Carlo as the appropriate technique since it incorporates the probability distribution of future equity values. Valuation specialists often assume the underlying equity (total equity or solely common) follows a stochastic process called Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).

### Valuation Methodology
The dynamics of the underlying equity can be expressed in mathematical form of
$$
\begin{equation}
  S_t = S_0 \exp\left[\left(\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)t + \sigma W_t\right]
  \label{eq:gbm_formula}
\end{equation}
$$

where each symbol represents (also the key inputs to the model):

$$

\begin{aligned}
S_0      & : \text{ equity value at time 0} \\
\mu      & : \text{ expected growth rate (typically risk-free rate (rfr) being used under risk-neutral measure)} \\
\sigma   & : \text{ volatility of underlying equity} \\
t        & : \text{ time to expiry (or an expected liquidity event)} \\
S_t      & : \text{ simulated equity value at time } t \\
W_t      & : \text{ random variable that follows normal distribution, } W_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, t) \\
\end{aligned}

$$

### Valuation Procedure
The valuation process typically involves the following steps:

1. Estimate the current equity value, either from observable market data or through a fundamental analysis performed by valuation specialists.
2. Simulate future equity value paths over the expected term.
3. Incorporate specific award terms, including waterfalls, senior preferences, vesting schedules, and performance triggers.
4. Calculate the payout for each simulated path based on the award structure.
5. Average the simulated payouts and discount the result to present value using the risk-free rate.

## Technical Valuation Memo

If a company has a simple capital structure or senior preferences have limited impact, equity-based awards may be valued by applying Monte Carlo directly to common equity without modeling the full capitalization. Auditors often scrutinize this approach when the common price relies on older 409A valuations, as private-company common may not fully reflect capital structure economics.

In terms of the movements of the values of the awards, since they are often conceptually viewed as call options on the underlying common stock, the results can be interpreted using Black–Scholes “Greeks.” The two inputs with the largest impact are:

- **Underlying price (delta):** Higher underlying value increases the award value.  
- **Volatility (vega):** Higher volatility increases the award value.  

A common point of confusion is **intrinsic value vs. fair value**:

- **Intrinsic value** = max(common price – strike price, 0). Measures moneyness and immediate proceeds at liquidity.
- **Fair value** includes intrinsic value **plus** time value, volatility, term, and risk-free rates.

Longer remaining term increases the award’s time value and moves it closer to the underlying common value.
