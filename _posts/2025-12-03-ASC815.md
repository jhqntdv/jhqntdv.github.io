## Introduction

Under **ASC 815 – Derivatives and Hedging**, entities must assess hybrid financial instruments, such as convertible bonds, to determine if embedded features (e.g., conversion options) require bifurcation and separate accounting as derivatives.

Bifurcation is recommended when the embedded feature is not clearly and closely related to the host contract, or when separate measurement provides more transparent reporting of distinct risks and values. When bifurcation is selected, only fair value changes in the derivative component flow through the earnings (affecting P&L) and the host debt accrues interest at a periodic expense recognition.

As an alternative approach, entities may measure the entire hybrid financial instrument at fair value under ASC 825-10 (Fair Value Option, FVO). In this case, all changes in fair value are recognized in earnings, which can result in more volatile P&L.

## Convertible Note - Hybrid Instrument

A convertible note is a hybrid financial instrument that combines characteristics of both debt and equity. It is structured as a debt security, typically paying interest and having a maturity date, but also includes an embedded option allowing the holder to convert the note into a predetermined number of shares of the issuer’s equity. 

Convertible notes often include a variety of embedded option features, which can add further complexity to their valuation and accounting treatment. Examples of such features include:

- **Holder's conversion right:** The holder may convert the note into specified number of shares when the stock price exceeds certain price.
- **Issurer's redemption right:** The issuer may redeem (repay) the note during a specified period before maturity, typically if the issuer believes the stock price will appreciate or certain conditions are met.
- **Forced conversion (soft call):** The issuer may force conversion of the note into equity if stock trading above a threshold for a specified period.

These features are captured using valuation techniques such as lattice (binomial  tree) models and Monte Carlo simulations.

## Valuation Methodology
Both approaches—lattice (binomial tree) models and Monte Carlo simulations—aim to capture the optimal decisions of each party and evaluate payouts over the life of the convertible note. Lattice models are often preferred by clients for their intuitive “decision tree” structure, which clearly shows choices at each node. Monte Carlo simulations, on the other hand, are favored by valuation specialists for their flexibility and ability to model complex path-dependent scenarios with greater accuracy.

For binomial tree approach, the valuation process typically involves the following steps:
1. Construct a binomial tree where each node represents possible future stock prices until maturity.
2. Build an array to track the accruing balance and cash dividends throughout the term.
3. Starting from the end nodes and working backward, calculate the continuation value, conversion value, and redemption value at each node.
4. Build a payoff tree of the same size, recording the payout associated with the optimal decision at each node.
5. Separate the payoff tree into equity and debt components: discount the equity component using the risk-free rate, and the debt component using the risk-free rate plus issuer-specific credit spread.
6. The fair value of the convertible bond is obtained once the backward induction is complete.

For Monte Carlo simulation approach, the valuation process typically involves the following steps:
1. Simulate future stock price paths, assuming the underlying follows geometric Brownian motion (GBM).
2. Build an array to track the accruing balance and cash dividends throughout the term.
3. For each simulated path and time point, calculate the effective continuation value, conversion value, and redemption value so they can be directly compared to determine the optimal decision.
4. Record the payout associated with the first optimal decision that occurs along each path.
5. Separate each payout into equity and debt components: discount the equity component using the risk-free rate, and the debt component using the risk-free rate plus issuer-specific credit spread.
6. The fair value of the convertible bond is obtained by averaging all discounted payoffs across the simulated paths.

The bifurcation applies the “with-and-without” approach, where the value of the embedded derivative is measured as the difference between the fair value of the full-featured convertible bond and the fair value of the bond with all embedded features removed (i.e., straight debt valued via discounted cash flow).

$$
\text{Convertible Bond Value} = \text{Straight Debt Value} + \text{Conversion Option Value}
$$

## Technical Valuation Memo

The binomial tree method described above is also known as the Tsiveriotis and Fernandes or Goldman model, as these were among the first approaches developed and widely adopted by practitioners. Key model inputs include the underlying stock price and its volatility, the issuer’s credit spread, and the risk-free interest rate. Each of these factors can be modeled as a separate source of randomness (stochastic process), and have been extensively studied by academics and advanced practitioners. For example, some use jump-diffusion models to capture default probability and stock price shocks, while others apply interest rate models such as Black-Derman-Toy (BDT) to treat the convertible bond as an interest rate derivative.

However, empirical studies show that for companies issuing convertibles, the most significant drivers are the underlying stock price and the issuer’s credit spread. From an accounting standpoint, equity volatility and issuer-specific credit spread are typically the most subjective inputs and are often challenged by auditors. This is especially true for private companies, where equity volatility may be high, but the convertible note is senior in the capital structure, resulting in a capped final volatility assumption. For the credit spread, it is generally determined by bridging the gap between the company’s cost of debt and the latest implied rate from comparable transactions.
